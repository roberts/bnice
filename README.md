# $BNICE on Base

BNice is launching Thursday, April 11th on Base Chain. Call Coinbase Support..

## Drew Roberts Commitment

- Contract deployed & made publicly available 24+ hours ahead of Liquidity Pool launch
- Public livestream of liquidity pool launch with project hosting X Space
- Liquidity Pool locked for over 1 year
- Transparency with token community & prior announcement of all dev actions

## Deployments

When deploying smart contracts, I use [this workflow](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/v2/tutorial/deploy) with the following services:

- [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/)
- [HardHat](https://hardhat.org)

## Contract Standard Features

With every token project I have launched over the past 3 years, I test a hypothesis with the team to improve the launch & long-term success of the project. Like a scientific study, I keep all the other variables in the contract & launch strategy the same and simply isolate this hypothesis for improvement. This approach allows me to confidently learn and iterate on the best practices I have developed for project teams. [View my old contract](https://github.com/roberts/standard/blob/main/old.sol). With these learnings, I have settled on the following read & write functions for the current contract standard:

- [Read Functions](https://github.com/roberts/standard/blob/main/functions/read.md)
- [Write Functions](https://github.com/roberts/standard/blob/main/functions/write.md)

My contract standard contains the following features:

### Lopsided Tax Structure

Through many experiments with tokenomics, I have found that optimal performance for long-term token projects is achieved through a 3/16 lopsided tax structure. It is important to have the option to reduce the lopsided sell tax for a stable 3/3 tax token and another option to remove taxes altogether.

### Restrict Modifiable Tax

To ensure community confidence & clearly communicate tax policy, the buy & sell taxes are not openly adjustable. I used to cap what they could be modified to, but find it is better to hard code just a couple options into the smart contract. The following tax functions are available to projects using this contract standard:

- reduceSellTax() - This function reduces the 16% sell tax to 3%, matching the buy tax so the token has a 3/3 tax.
- removeTax() - This function removes the buy and sell tax so the token has a 0/0 tax.
- resetTax() - This function resets the token back to the 3/16 lopsided tax structure.

### Tax Wallets

Long-term projects work best when there is clear budgeting within the token tax structure between 3 wallets and those wallets are clearly identified. I also believe it is best for projects to have different individuals with control of these wallets and it is communicated on the project's website. This contract standard contains the following:

- Community Wallet - Controlled by the project's CEO or community manager
- Marketing Wallet - Controlled by the project's CMO or marketing director
- Developer Wallet - Controlled by the project's CTO or lead developer

For project longevity, these wallets are updateable in the contract. This allows teams to use a marketing manager for launch and a different marketing manager for ongoing efforts or just for natural turnover in positions over time. You have the new team member in that role create a fresh wallet only they have control over then we update the smart contract to divert the appropriate tax revenue to that wallet. There are 3 functions to update these wallets:

- updateCommunityWallet()
- updateMarketingWallet()
- updateDeveloperWallet()

### Withdraw Tokens

There are 2 functions for withdrawing tokens in the contract:

- withdrawStuckTokens() - This function withdraws the tokens in the contract
- withdrawStuckETH() - This function withdraws the Ethereum in the contract

### Enable Trading

The following function enables trading of tokens:

- enableTrading() - This function launches the Uniswap V2 Liquidity Pool with the tokens & ETH in the contract

### Anti-Whale Restrictins

There are 2 anti-whale restrictions in this contract standard. The first is a max transaction that I have found is best to be 2% or less of the total supply. The second is a max wallet which I have found is best to be 5% of the total supply, allowing multiple buys. These are necessary for heavily marketed launches and to prevent whales accumulating at launch, especially bots. 15-30 minutes after launch, this should be removed with the following function:

- removeRestrictions() - This function removes the max transaction and the max wallet

### Ownership

There are 2 functions for ownership in the Contract Standard:

- transferOwnership() - This function transfers the contract to another Ethereum address
- renounceOwnership() - This function sends the contract to the Dead Address

## Contract Standard Does NOT Contain

Here is a list of things I have seen in smart contracts for ERC-20 tokens that I believe are not in the best long-term interest of the project's community and will not include in this contract standard. This contract standard does NOT contain the following:

- No Transfer Fee
- No Whitelist
- No Blacklist
- No Mint
